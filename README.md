Pygmeeweb blog
==================

Blog's URL is http://pygmeeweb.com/

# A complete rewrite is on is way. Stay tuned !

## Why this blog

In order to get a really fast personal home page I wanted to get rid of all the php frameworks I was using.
Focusing on the client side performance can now really be the point !
That's why I switched from Symfony/php driven to Jekyll.

## How this blog is done

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and some salt and pepper from all over the web.
It was formerly running on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) but I now largely prefer [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) which offers alot more functionalities.
