How to use Git and [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow "gitflow repository on github") on Ubuntu

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install git git-gui git-flow
{% endhighlight %}

To have autocompletion for git flow, you can use [git-flow-completion](https://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion)

You can now use [gitflow commands](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow#creating-featurereleasehotfixsupport-branches) that works well an is [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), really a must read.

Happy versioning.
