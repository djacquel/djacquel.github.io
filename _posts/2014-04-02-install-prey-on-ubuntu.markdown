A useful tool to recover stolen laptop.
It runs on Linux, Android, Mac and also Windows. Let me introduce you to [Prey][prey].

As they say :
> Prey lets you keep track of your laptop, phone and tablet whenever missing, whether you're in town or abroad.
The free account version allows you to track and recover 3 devices.

## Installing Prey on Ubuntu

 - if you don't already have a Prey account, [create one][preySignup]
 - download ubuntu deb package from [Prey download section][preyDownload]
 - install it by clinking the deb file
 - ctrl+alt+t to open a console
 - **sudo /usr/share/prey/platform/linux/prey-config.py** to run the graphic interface (gui)
 - once on the gui select __reporting mode__ tab
 - click __forward__
 - enter you email and password used to create your Prey account
 - select **create a new device in my control panel**
 - check you email and password if you have something else than a succesful creation message

You can now go to your [Prey panel][preyPanel] to manage setup your laptop recovery.
